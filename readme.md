# WeatherTalk

### By Jordan Speizer

This project is a simple front-end app built in Angular. Using the Weather Underground and Twitter APIs, it allows the user to see the weather and relevant tweets from any location in the domestic US. 

The project is loosely based off [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), with quite a few modifications made. 

## Getting Started

To get started you can simply clone the weather-talk repository and install the dependencies using NPM.

Thanks to Angular Seed, `npm` is preconfigured to automatically run `bower` so all you need to do is:

```
npm install
```

That will install all dependencies. From there you just need to start the server like so:

```
npm start
```

And browse to `http://localhost:8000` and you should see the app.

index.html              --> App layout file
gulpfile.js             --> Used for generating dist files and docs
karma.conf.js           --> For test running
bower.json              --> bower dependencies
package.json            --> NPM dependencies

```

## Making Changes

Make sure you have gulp active by running the following while in the project root:

```
gulp
```

Gulp will watch for any changes to .js or .css files and automatically compile them to the dist folder. When adding new files to the project, you may need to add their path to the gulpfile in order for gulp to pick them up when compiling.

## Testing

Tests can be run by:

```
npm test
```

That will boot up karma which can be configured in karma.conf.js file. Current test coverage is poor and is certainly a high-priority todo.

## Docs

The docs are auto generated by running:

```
gulp docs
```

and live at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
